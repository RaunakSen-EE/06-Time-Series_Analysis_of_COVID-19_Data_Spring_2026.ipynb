# 📊 Time-Series Analysis of COVID-19 Data — Spring Internship 2026

This project focuses on performing exploratory data analysis and time-series aggregation on global COVID-19 data to understand pandemic trends across countries and WHO regions. The analysis involves data preprocessing, temporal filtering, statistical aggregation, and regional comparisons using Python and Pandas.

## Project Objectives
